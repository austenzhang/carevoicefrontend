# Carevoice Front End - A University of Calgary Nursing-Engineering Hackathon Project

This is the Front end repository for Carevoice.

On March 1, 2025, a joint Hackathon was conducted between the Nursing and Software Engineering M.Eng students.

This project sought to create an application that a nurse could use to transcribe meetings with patients and automatically fill out routine forms such as the Head-to-Toe assessment and DARP forms.

The deployed application can be found here:

This project was a joint effort between 11 Software Engineering students and 4 Nursing students.

My (Austen Zhang) contributions: I contributed to the voice scribing functionality, which used the Deepgram speech-to-text API to convert the recorded audio file into a string. I also contributed to the front end "record" paeg, implementing the recording functionality and sending required information to the backend.
